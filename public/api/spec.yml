    ### Service Overview
    The data service provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) that enables you to add Mims data capabilities within your application.
    ### API Overview
    The Data Service provides the following endpoints:
    * `/status` - get the status of our services.
    ### API Usage
    The following information provides details about using the service to search the Mims database:
    * **HTTP REST interfaces:** You can use methods of the session-based, sessionless, or asynchronous HTTP interfaces to pass search data to the service. All interfaces let you send the data via the body of the request; the session-based and sessionless.
    * **Authentication:** You authenticate to the service by using your service credentials. You can use your credentials to obtain a token and contact the service directly.
